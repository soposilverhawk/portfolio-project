## 🔍 Overview

### ❗Owner Access Guide

In order to access the Owner editor rights, to edit sections apart from feedbacks, please insert "1" as the password to the prompt that you'll receive upon clicking "Know more" button on the homepage. As the project is NOT inteded for commercial use, I decided to indicate a very simple and plain password for ease of use for potential employers.

### 📖 What I learned

I dipped my toes in Next.js with Client side rendering in this project. I learned how navigation works and differs with Next.js compared to React. Apart from that, I learned how to work with environment variables and how to host a Next.js project using Vercel. I think this was a great first experience with Next.js and I plan to further utilize it and enhance my understanding in it.
